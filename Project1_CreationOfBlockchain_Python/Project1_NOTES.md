-Blockchain is essentially a chain of Blockch, in which each block contains some data. In the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc..
the data is a list of transactions. Blockchain is MORE than that, it can contain bassically any type of information.

----Wide view about this first small project-----
I need to answer the question "What I am going to do now?"
The answer is:

1-Using python to build a small and simple blockchain


----Let's talk about that code-----
I need to now "How I am going to do it?"
The answers are:

1-Define the Blockchain Class:
    /Blockchain Class: Main structure that will hold the Blockchain
    /It has 2 main parts:
        a- The chain itself (a list of blocks)
        b- The current transactions (List of transactions that will be added to the next block)
