Project2 uses the code created in the first Project, being a continuation of it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project2 will involve extending the blockchain created (Poject1) with a:

    A: Transaction system.

    B: Reward (mining) system. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the steps Iâ€™ll follow:


1-/////    TRANSACTION SYSTEM    /////:

    A-Modification of the "new_transaction" method in Blockchain Class to include "VERIFICATION PROCESS"

    B-Verification process will check if sender has enough balance for transaction



2-/////    MINING SYSTEM    /////:

    A-New method: "Mine"

    B-Mine():This method represent the process of mining a new block. It till include a "reward system" 


3-/////    BALANCE CHECKING    /////:

    A-Creation of a method to check Balance of a given participant in the Blockchain

    B-


4-/////    PROOF-OF-WORK    /////:

    A-Implementation of Proof-of-Work algorithm
    
        This is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability, so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated.
